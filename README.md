# Covid CT Classfication
## Objective
To classify CT scan images into Covid and Non-Covid using Multi-Layer Perceptron implemented with the help of [MLP Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier) of Scikit Learn.

## Running the model
* Import [Covid_CT_Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/satyam748/Covid-CT-Classfication/blob/main/Covid_CT_Classification.ipynb) file into google colaboratory
* Import Dataset in google drive and access that in  colaboratory
* Run each cell one by one and result are produced at the end.
